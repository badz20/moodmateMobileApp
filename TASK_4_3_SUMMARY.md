# Task 4.3 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 4.3 "Counsellor Provides Advice (UC-09)" has been successfully implemented. This feature enables real-time messaging between users and their assigned counsellors through an intuitive chat interface with comprehensive features.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Model

#### MessageModel (`lib/models/message_model.dart`)

Complete message data structure with:

- `id`, `conversationThreadId`
- `senderId`, `receiverId`
- `content`
- `timestamp`
- `isRead`, `readAt` - Read status tracking

### 2. Services

#### MessageService (`lib/services/message_service.dart`)

Comprehensive messaging functionality:

- `sendMessage()` - Send new messages and update conversation thread
- `getMessages()` - Fetch all messages for a conversation
- `streamMessages()` - Real-time message updates with Firestore snapshots
- `markMessageAsRead()` - Mark individual message as read
- `markAllMessagesAsRead()` - Bulk mark messages as read
- `getUnreadMessageCount()` - Count unread messages for a user
- `deleteMessage()` - Soft delete (updates content to "[Message deleted]")
- `getConversationThreadIdByRequestId()` - Find conversation by support request
- `getConversationThread()` - Get conversation thread details

### 3. User Interface

#### ConversationScreen (`lib/screens/counsellor/conversation_screen.dart`)

Full-featured chat interface with:

**Core Features:**

- Real-time message streaming with Firestore snapshots
- Auto-scrolling to latest messages
- Automatic read receipts
- Message sending with retry on failure
- Pull-to-refresh message history

**UI Components:**

- Clean message bubbles (sent vs received styling)
- Date dividers (Today, Yesterday, or formatted date)
- Timestamp display for each message
- Double-check marks for read messages (blue when read, grey when delivered)
- Online status indicator
- Message input field with send button
- Loading and error states
- Empty state for no messages

**Message Display:**

- Different colors for sent (primary color) vs received (grey) messages
- Message bubbles aligned to right (sent) or left (received)
- Rounded corners with asymmetric radius for chat bubble effect
- Character limit preview (100 chars in notifications)
- Multi-line message support

**User Experience:**

- Smooth animations when scrolling to new messages
- Loading indicator while sending
- Message restoration on send failure
- Keyboard submit support (Enter key)
- SafeArea handling for modern devices

### 4. Cloud Functions

#### notifyOnNewMessage (`functions/src/index.ts`)

Firebase Cloud Function triggered on new message:

- Listens to `conversation_threads/{threadId}/messages/{messageId}` onCreate
- Fetches receiver's FCM token from users collection
- Gets sender's name for personalized notification
- Sends push notification with:
  - Title: "New message from {senderName}"
  - Body: First 100 characters of message content
  - Data payload with thread ID and sender ID
  - High priority for Android
  - Sound and badge for iOS
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. Integration

#### Updated Support Requests Screen

Enhanced `support_requests_screen.dart` with:

- Added `MessageService` import and initialization
- Updated "View Conversation" button to actually navigate
- Fetches conversation thread details
- Determines other user dynamically
- Handles errors gracefully
- Shows appropriate error messages

**Navigation Flow:**

1. User views support request
2. Clicks "View Conversation" button
3. System fetches conversation thread details
4. Determines other participant (user or counsellor)
5. Navigates to ConversationScreen
6. Real-time chat begins

### 6. Security & Privacy

**Firestore Security Rules (Already Configured):**

- Messages subcollection within conversation_threads
- Read: Only participants (user & counsellor) and admins
- Create: Only participants, must be sender
- Update: Only sender can update their own messages
- Delete: Admin only

**Access Control:**

- Verified participant relationship before message display
- Server-side validation through Firestore rules
- Read receipts only visible to sender
- Message deletion maintains audit trail

## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Updates

- Uses Firestore `snapshots()` for live data
- StreamSubscription management with proper disposal
- Auto-scrolling with post-frame callbacks
- Efficient list updates with setState

### Message Storage

- Messages stored in subcollection: `conversation_threads/{id}/messages`
- Ordered by timestamp ascending (chronological)
- Automatic lastMessageAt update on conversation thread
- Efficient querying with Firestore indexes

### Read Status

- Marks messages as read when conversation is viewed
- Updates isRead and readAt fields
- Batch updates for efficiency
- Query optimization for unread counts

## Database Structure

### Messages Subcollection

Path: `conversation_threads/{threadId}/messages/{messageId}`

```
{
  conversationThreadId: string,
  senderId: string,
  receiverId: string,
  content: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  isRead: boolean,
  readAt: timestamp (nullable)
}
```

### Conversation Thread Updates

- `lastMessageAt` updated on each new message
- Enables sorting conversations by recent activity

## User Flow

### For Users:

1. Submit support request to counsellor
2. Counsellor accepts request (creates conversation thread)
3. User views "My Support Requests"
4. Clicks "View Conversation" on accepted request
5. Opens chat interface
6. Send/receive messages in real-time
7. Receive push notifications for new messages
8. See read receipts on sent messages

### For Counsellors:

1. Accept support request from client
2. View "My Clients" or "Support Requests"
3. Click "View Conversation" on request with thread
4. Opens chat interface
5. Provide advice and support via messaging
6. See when client reads messages
7. Real-time communication

## Integration Points

1. **Firebase Authentication** - User identity verification
2. **Cloud Firestore** - Message storage and real-time sync
3. **Firestore Snapshots** - Live message updates
4. **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Message notifications
5. **Firebase Cloud Messaging** - Push notification delivery
6. **Support Request System** - Conversation creation trigger

## Performance Optimizations

- Firestore query optimization (indexed timestamps)
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.builder
- Proper stream subscription disposal
- Minimal rebuilds with targeted setState calls
- Lazy loading with pagination support (built-in)

## Files Created

## Testing Considerations

To test this feature:

1. Create support request and have counsellor accept it
2. Verify conversation thread is created
3. Test real-time messaging from both sides
4. Verify read receipts update correctly
5. Test push notifications (requires physical device)
6. Test offline mode (messages queue and sync)
7. Verify message history persists
8. Test error scenarios (network issues, etc.)

## Completion Status
